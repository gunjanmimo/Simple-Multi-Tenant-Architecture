# Simple Multi Tenant Architecture


Multi-tenant architecture is an architectural pattern commonly used in software applications where a single instance of the application serves multiple clients, known as tenants. Each tenant is isolated from other tenants and operates as if it has its own dedicated instance of the application.

In a multi-tenant architecture, tenants share the same infrastructure, database, and codebase, but their data and configurations are kept separate. This allows multiple organizations or users to use the application simultaneously while maintaining data privacy and security.

The benefits of a multi-tenant architecture include:

- Cost efficiency: By sharing resources, such as servers and databases, among multiple tenants, the overall infrastructure costs can be reduced.

- Scalability: The architecture can easily scale to accommodate new tenants without requiring significant changes to the underlying infrastructure.

- Customization: Each tenant can have its own configurations, settings, and branding, allowing for customization based on individual requirements.

- Maintenance and updates: Updates and maintenance tasks can be performed centrally, reducing the effort required to manage multiple instances of the application.
